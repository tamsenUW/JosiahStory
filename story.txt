Once upon a time, there was a blue spotted cow named Frank. Frank began eating grass along the side of the road near the edge of his owner's farm-land. While a car was passing by a very excited boy took a flash-picture of the unusually colored cow. This made the cow angry and in a fit of rage he ran through the barriers and into the street where he was hit by a bus.
