Once upon a time, there was a blue spotted cow named Frank. Frank began eating grass along the side of the road near the edge of his owner's farm-land. While a car was passing by, a very excited boy took a flash-picture of the unusually colored cow. This made the cow angry, and in a fit of rage, he ran throgh the barriers and into the street where he was hit by a bus.
Immediately upon seeing this, the farmer called a vet in the hopes that Frank may still survive. Meanwhile, the boy walked up to Frank mocking him as he laid helpless on the ground. The boy laughed and said "No need to have a cow." Frank was furious at that deplorable pun; he was not going to go down without a fight.
While mocking the injured cow, the boy jumped onto Frank's back. Sensing an opportunity, Frank leaped off the ground and began running wild. Frank, with all his might, thrashed around to get the boy off of his back and teach him a lesson. The boy quickly lost his strength and went flying through the air. There is a bored angel comes down to the farmland who sees all of this. The angel love peace so he save Frank and the boy with his magic. He asks the boy and Frank say sorry to each others and be the best friends forever. The boy obliges and apologizes to Frank. Despite the problems they had before, though the power of love and friendship, they are able to get along well.
