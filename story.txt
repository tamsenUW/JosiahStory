Once upon a time, there was a blue spotted cow named Frank. Frank began eating grass along the side of the road near the edge of his owner's farm-land. While a car was passing by, a very excited boy took a flash-picture of the unusually colored cow. This made the cow angry, and in a fit of rage, he ran throgh the barriers and into the street where he was hit by a bus.
Immediately upon seeing this, the farmer called a vet in the hopes that Frank may still survive. Meanwhile, the boy walked up to Frank mocking him as he laid helpless on the ground. The boy laughed and said "No need to have a cow." Frank was furious at that deplorable pun; he was not going to go down without a fight.
